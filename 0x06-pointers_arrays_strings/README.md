0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What are pointers and how to use them
    What are arrays and how to use them
    What are the differences between pointers and arrays
    How to use strings and how to manipulate them
    Scope of variables

0. strcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
    This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
    Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.

1. strncat
mandatory

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
    Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.
